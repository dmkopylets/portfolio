**This is my first experience learning Laravel on my own.**
Livewire technology, which I am interested in, is involved.

dynamic data entry forms in PHP

The launched program contains a menu at the bottom for correcting reference data

outfits are created "from scratch" or generated based on an existing one
Each outfit can be exported in pdf format
