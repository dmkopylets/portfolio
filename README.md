# portfolio
examples of my code

*******************************************

_what is here:_

* 1. [console.app](https://github.com/dmkopylets/portfolio/tree/main/console.app) - a console PHP-program that can be used for service tasks such as data import
    
* 2. On [Laravel-sql](https://github.com/dmkopylets/portfolio/tree/main/Laravel-sql-seeding) - maked writing migrations, seeds that generate test data.

* 3. [Racing Report](https://github.com/dmkopylets/portfolio/tree/main/Racing%20Report) - a simple application using Laravel and AdminLTE

         which demonstrates manipulation
         data, CLI-command that parses and saves data from txt-files to a database. Added REST API (Swagger). 
            The program processes parameters (json, xml).
            E.g. http://localhost:5000/api/v1/report/?format=xml

* 4. [orders.journaling](https://github.com/dmkopylets/orders.journaling) - a terribly written but working program from a very long time ago... (this is practically my first experience in self-study Laravel)

         Laravel and Liveware are involved, that makes it possible to enter certain reference data and create a journal of typical orders for performing some work (for example, a team of electricians)

         Attention: The interface and data are in Ukrainian

## Frontend skils demo:
