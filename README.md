examples of my code

_what is here:_

    1. "console.app" - a console program that can be used for service tasks such as data import

    2. "Racing Report" - a simple application using Laravel and AdminLTE, which demonstrates manipulation
    of array-like data, but actually uses SplObjectStorage, CLI-command that parses and saves data from 
    txt-files to a database. Added REST API (Swagger). The program processes parameters (json, xml).
    E.g. http://localhost:5000/api/v1/report/?format=xml

    3. "outfits.journaling" - a program using Laravel and Liveware that makes it possible to enter certain 
    reference data and create a journal of typical outfits for performing some work 
    (for example, a team of electricians)
